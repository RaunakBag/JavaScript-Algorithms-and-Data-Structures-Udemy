                    <p>
                        Gandhi himself wrote that Bose's "... patriotism is second to none",and he was moved to proclaim after Bose's death that he was a "prince among patriots"â€”a reference, in particular, to Bose's achievement in integrating women and men from all the regions and religions of India in the Indian National Army.
